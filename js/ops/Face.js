/**
 * A face is usually contained by an ("inner") boundary of edges, and zero or more ("outer") boundary holes on the inside.
 * The naming is somewhat counterintuitive here, because the "inner" boundaries are on the inside of the edges
 * (towards our face), and the "outer" hole boundaries are on the outer half-edges of the holes.
 *
 * There is normally one "unbounded" face without a normal boundary, whose "area" expands to infinity, and contains the
 * everything on the exterior of all of the edges.
