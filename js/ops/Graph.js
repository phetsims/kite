/**
 * A multigraph whose edges are segments.
 *
 * Supports general shape simplification, overlap/intersection removal and computation. General output would include
 * Shapes (from CAG - Constructive Area Geometry) and triangulations.
 *
 * See Graph.binaryResult for the general procedure for CAG.
 *
 * TODO: Use https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS for priority queue, implement simple sweep line https://github.com/phetsims/kite/issues/102
 *       with "enters" and "leaves" entries in the queue. When edge removed, remove "leave" from queue.
 *       and add any replacement edges. Applies to overlap and intersection handling.
 *       NOTE: This should impact performance a lot, as we are currently over-scanning and re-scanning a lot.
 *       Intersection is currently (by far?) the performance bottleneck.
 * TODO: Collapse non-Line adjacent edges together. Similar logic to overlap for each segment time, hopefully can
 *       factor this out.
 * TODO: Properly handle sorting edges around a vertex when two edges have the same tangent out. We'll need to use
 *       curvature, or do tricks to follow both curves by an 'epsilon' and sort based on that.
 * TODO: Consider separating out epsilon values (may be a general Kite thing rather than just ops)
 * TODO: Loop-Blinn output and constrained Delaunay triangulation

   *
   * The winding map is an {Object} associated with each face that has a key for every shapeId that was used in
   * addShape/addSubpath, and the value for those keys is the winding number of the face given all paths with the
   * shapeId.
   *
   * For example, imagine you added two shapeIds (0 and 1), and the iteration is on a face that is included in
   * one loop specified with shapeId:0 (inside a counter-clockwise curve), and is outside of any segments specified
   * by the second loop (shapeId:1). Then the winding map will be:
   * {
   *   0: 1 // shapeId:0 has a winding number of 1 for this face (generally filled)
   *   1: 0 // shapeId:1 has a winding number of 0 for this face (generally not filled)
   * }
   *
   * Generally, winding map filters can be broken down into two steps:
   * 1. Given the winding number for each shapeId, compute whether that loop was originally filled. Normally, this is
   *    done with a non-zero rule (any winding number is filled, except zero). SVG also provides an even-odd rule
   *    (odd numbers are filled, even numbers are unfilled).
   * 2. Given booleans for each shapeId from step 1, compute CAG operations based on boolean formulas. Say you wanted
   *    to take the union of shapeIds 0 and 1, then remove anything in shapeId 2. Given the booleans above, this can
   *    be directly computed as (filled0 || filled1) && !filled2.
